### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a recent graduate from @lewagon and passionate about fullstack development. I love learning new languages and skills. I'm fun to work with, I always like to learn new things from others as much as helping others solve their problems. I am working on my web dev jokes repertoire, feel free to share yours!
